# Dhir-Repository
This is the test repository created by Dhirender to check how it works.

Hope this will work and Dhirender get to know how he can create the new repository and branch.
After this I will check the pull request and then merge functionality

New branch has been created earlier by mistake the changes was done on the home branch
